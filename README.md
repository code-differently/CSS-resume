### Part 2a - External Styles continued
All the CSS code for this should be in your `style.css` file. 

1. Finish styling the nav menu in the header. Use a `psuedo` class selector to help define the behavior in your nav menu. Change either the background color or the text color when you hover. 
2. Connect the nav bar header across all pages within your site. Remember, this should use  `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` in the `<head`
3. Complete all parts of your resume.
4. Use a mix of universal, class, and ID selectors.
5. Have an `em` or `rem` font size option.

### Part 2b - CSS Styles for Forms
It's time to add styling to your contact form

1. Your contact form should have headings outside of the field choices
2. Set the H2 heading size as a REM (this means you'll need to define a body font size as well)
3. Use `<div>` to create well designed sections of the contact page.
